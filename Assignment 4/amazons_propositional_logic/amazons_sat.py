"""
For the n-amazon problem, the only code you have to do is in this file.

You should replace

# your code here

by a code generating a list of clauses modeling the n-amazons problem
for the input file.

You should build clauses using the Clause class defined in clause.py

Here is an example presenting how to create a clause:
Let's assume that the length/width of the chessboard is 4.
To create a clause X_0_1 OR ~X_1_2 OR X_3_3
you can do:

clause = Clause(4)
clause.add_positive(0, 1)
clause.add_negative(1, 2)
clause.add_positive(3, 3)

The clause must be initialized with the length/width of the chessboard.
The reason is that we use a 2D index for our variables but the format
imposed by MiniSAT requires a 1D index.
The Clause class automatically handle this change of index, but needs to know the
number of column and row in the chessboard.

X_0_0 is the literal representing the top left corner of the chessboard
